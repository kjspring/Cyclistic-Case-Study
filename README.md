# Capstone Details

### Scenario

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

I have been assigned the following question to answer: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently**?

### Data

I used [Cyclistic’s historical trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to analyze and identify trends. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable me to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under [this license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).)
